# Encryption-Decryption-Application
A DES like encryption/decryption mechanism written in C

to compile:
    - gcc -o mycipher my-cipher.c 
    
run with same commands as the lab asks:
    - ex. /my-cipher --ECB --enc 5 123

create a file named plaintext.txt with the binary text you wish to encrypt
create a file named decryptedtext.txt with the binary text you wish to encrypt

please note to decrypt the encrypted text you just create you need to copy and past into the decryptedtext.txt
